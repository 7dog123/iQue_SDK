<h3>Purpose</h3>
The iQue Software Development Kit provides all the tools and
libraries necessary to develop applications that will run on the
iQue Player. &nbsp;The SDK includes an iQue Player with a special
software
environment that allows the testing of locally developed games.<br>
<h3>Development System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A PC with at least 256MB of RAM, 200MB of free disk space and a
CDROM drive</li>
  <li>At least one USB port and a USB cable with Cat-A and 5-pin Mini-B
connectors.<br>
  </li>
  <li>RedHat Linux version 8.0 or 9 with at least the following
packages installed:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Kernel source (required to build the SDK USB driver loadable
module)</li>
    <li>GCC and ELF tools</li>
    <li>Perl<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
The SDK includes the following items:<br>
<ul>
  <li>cross compiler suite for building MIPS binaries for the iQue
Player</li>
  <li>libraries, including graphics and audio support for the iQue
Player</li>
  <li>header files required to build iQue games</li>
  <li>iQue tools for creating game executables<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <li>source for the linux driver required to connect to the iQue
Player using USB<br>
  </li>
  <li>online documentation</li>
  <li>sample source code for iQue Player applications<br>
  </li>
</ul>
In order to install the SDK, please use the following procedures:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Place the SDK cdrom in the cdrom drive of the linux development
host. &nbsp;If the CD is not automatically mounted, then issue the
following commands to make it accessible (note that these commands
require <b>root</b> privilege and that the directory <i>/mnt/cdrom</i>
may need to be created first):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>su</li>
    <li>mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom (not required if the directory already
exists)<br>
    </li>
    <li>mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Once the SDK cdrom is mounted, execute the following commands as <b>root</b>:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>cd /mnt/cdrom</li>
    <li>./install.sh<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Each developer on the system must install the non-shared portions
of the SDK relative to their home directory based on the setting of
$ROOT:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>login as user</li>
    <li>mkdir $HOME/ique_root (note that this directory name is just an
example)</li>
    <li>ROOT=$HOME/ique_root; export ROOT</li>
    <li>/opt/ique/sdk/install.sh</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Building Applications</h3>
In order to use the SDK to create applications, each developer on the
linux host will need to install the user-specific portions of
the SDK as described above. &nbsp;In addition to setting the $ROOT
environment variable, please also add the following directory to the
$PATH environment variable used by the linux shell:<br>
<ul>
  <li>$ROOT/usr/sbin</li>
</ul>
For example, a <i>bash</i> user would add the following command to
their <i>$HOME/.bash_profile</i> script:<br>
<ul>
  <li>PATH=$PATH:$ROOT/usr/sbin</li>
  <li>export PATH</li>
</ul>
For examples of how to build a game executable, refer to the make
command file (GNUmakefile) for the demo applications included with the
SDK. &nbsp;Note that there are several additional steps after the
invocation of makerom:<br>
<ul>
  <li>makerom -r game.rom spec</li>
  <li>rommd -c 4 game.rom</li>
  <li>aesrom game.rom game.aes</li>
</ul>
The <i>rommd</i> command above specifies that the game supports up to
4 emulated "Controller Paks" for storing game state (refer to the
discussion of persistent game state below). &nbsp;The <i>aesrom</i>
command encrypts the resulting game rom, so that it can be launched
using the SDK game launcher (called<i> devmon</i>). &nbsp;Once the game
file has been encrypted, use <i>devmon</i> and <i>devsh</i> to copy
the new game to the cartridge:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the special SDK iQue Player to the linux host
using the Cat-A to Mini-B (5 pin) USB cable</li>
  <li>Boot the iQue Player, which brings up <i>devmon </i>and shows a
list of the files on the current cartridge</li>
  <li>On the linux host, start "<i>$ROOT/usr/sbin/mux</i>" in a
separate terminal window</li>
  <li>Then invoke "<i>devsh</i>" in the directory containing the game
rom file. &nbsp;The following <i>devsh</i> commands delete a
pre-existing version of the game binary and replace it with the newly
created one:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>d game.aes</li>
    <li>a game.aes</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
The game should appear on the list of available files shown
by <i>devmon.</i> &nbsp;The game can be invoked by selecting the
appropriate entry, using the D pad on the player, and then pushing the
A button to launch the game.<br>
<h3>Debugging Applications</h3>
There are two primary ways to debug applications using the SDK:
&nbsp;add <i>osSyncPrintf</i> calls to the source code or use the GNU
Debugger (<i>gdb</i>) for source level debugging. &nbsp;The library
call <i>osSyncPrintf</i> allows the program to send formatted messages
over the USB cable to be
printed in a window on the linux host. &nbsp;In order to see the
output, please keep a separate terminal window open in which the
program <i>$ROOT/usr/sbin/mux</i> is running. &nbsp;The print messages
from the calls to <i>osSyncPrintf</i> will appear in the window
running <i>mux</i>.<br>
<br>
For information about using <i>gdb</i> to debug iQue Player
Applications, please follow this link:<br>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Detailed documentation on writing programs for the iQue Player,
including descriptions of details of all the library routines which are
available to the programmer, can be found by following the included
link, using a web browser:<br>
<br>
<a href="file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/N64OnlineManuals52/index.htm">file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/N64OnlineManuals52/index.htm</a><br>
<br>
Note that the documentation provided is directly from the Nintendo 64
SDK. &nbsp;Not all features of the N64 system are supported on the
iQue player. &nbsp;See the next section for details.<br>
<h3>Differences Between Nintendo64 and the&nbsp; iQue Player</h3>
The following N64 features are not supported on the iQue Player:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Rumble pack</li>
  <li>N64 disk drive (64DD)</li>
  <li>No PIF<br>
  </li>
  <li>EEPROM, Controller Pak, SRAM and Flash ROM are not directly
supported, but can be emulated as described below</li>
  <li>The cpu on the iQue Player runs at 1.5x the clock rate of the cpu
on N64. &nbsp;If a programmer uses the mfc0 instruction to access the
COUNT and COMPARE registers of the cpu as an absolute time reference,
the results will be different on the iQue Player. &nbsp;The values
returned by the <i>osGetCount()</i> and <i>osSetCompare()</i> calls
have been scaled on the iQue Player in such a way that a program
written for N64 will get the same absolute time behavior on the iQue
Player.</li>
  <li>The access time of the flash cartridge on the iQue Player is
faster than that of the N64 maskrom when accesses are done in large
chunks (16KB). &nbsp;On the iQue Player there is a significant penalty
for accessing the flash using PIOs to read small chunks randomly.
&nbsp;For best performance, the game should be designed to access the
flash using large sequential reads.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<i><b>Persistent Game State on the iQue Player</b></i><br>
<br>
The N64 system provides 4 different hardware backup devices for storing
persistent game state: Controller Pak, EEPROM, SRAM, and Flash
ROM.&nbsp; These devices exist either in the N64 controller or in a
particular game's cartridge.&nbsp; The iQue Player system does not
provide such hardware, but provides emulation of each type of backup
device using a combination of DRAM and the iQue Flash Cartridge.<br>
<br>
When a game is initially launched on the iQue Player, the persistent
game state is loaded from the flash cartridge into a known location
in the upper 4MB of<br>
DRAM.&nbsp; All state reading and writing operations have been
modified to access this DRAM memory instead of an actual device.&nbsp;
When the game is exited (by pressing the power button), the state in
DRAM
is then copied back out to the flash cartridge.<br>
<br>
The game launching program examines a game's "metadata" to determine
what type of persistent state, if any, is used and where in DRAM it
will be located. &nbsp;After building a ROM image (and before
encrypting
it), the developer can attach "metadata" to the image using the <i>$ROOT/usr/sbin/rommd</i>
program:<br>
<ul>
  <li>rommd [options] romfile</li>
</ul>
The options specify what type of state saving mechanism is to be
emulated:<br>
<ul>
  <li>-e &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; This ROM has 'n' Kb EEPROM (valid values for n
are 0, 4, or 16)</li>
  <li>-f &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; This ROM has 'n' Kb Flash (valid values for n
are 0 or 1024)</li>
  <li>-s &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; This ROM has 'n' Kb SRAM (valid values for n
are 0 or 256)</li>
  <li>-c &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; This ROM supports up to 'n' 32KB controller
paks (n is between 0-4)</li>
  <li>-u &lt;n&gt;&nbsp; This ROM supports up to 'n' 16KB or 32KB
auxiliary data (.u0x) files (n is between 0-4)</li>
</ul>
If the <i>rommd</i> program is run without options, it displays the
existing "metadata" attached to the specified rom file.<br>
<h3>Potential Problems and Solutions</h3>
Perl scripts that process UTF-8 characters fail with error messages
like:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected end of string) at
i10n/tools/zh/zh_genmap16.pl line 13.</li>
  <li>Malformed UTF-8 character (2 bytes, need 1, after start byte
0xc0) in vec at i10n/tools/zh/zh_kanji.pl line 155.</li>
</ul>
The standard internationalization configuration file <i>/etc/sysconfig/i18n</i>
that is provided with RedHat causes the Perl character handling
routines to fail. &nbsp;A version of this configuration file is
supplied with
the SDK that provides a "workaround" for this problem. &nbsp;To install
the new version, login as <b>root</b> and use the following steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>cd /etc/sysconfig</li>
  <li>mv i18n i18n.redhat</li>
  <li>cp /opt/ique/sdk/doc/i18n ./i18n<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from SDK v1.0 to v1.1</h3>
The following bugs were fixed between versions 1.0 and 1.1:<br>
<ul>
  <li>On version 1.0, devmon would frequently fail to launch games.
&nbsp;This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Return a proper flash ID from osFlashReadID (for Majora's
Mask).</li>
  <li>Fix to allow 8MB games to work (for Majora's Mask).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from SDK v1.1 to v1.2</h3>
The following features were added between versions 1.1 and 1.2:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A source level debugger based on the GNU Debugger<i> (gdb</i>),
including support for a GUI interface to <i>gdb.</i></li>
  <li>The libultra primitive for reading the Real-Time Clock is now
exported (<i>osBbRtcGet</i>)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The following bugs were fixed between versions 1.1 and 1.2:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fix <i>osFlashReadArray</i> to send a message to the supplied
message queue even if the passed parameters are not valid.</li>
  <li>The installation script for the SDK would fail to install the
correct symlink in $ROOT/doc for the index.html file if an old version
of the SDK had already been installed by the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from SDK v1.2 to v1.3</h3>
The following features were added between versions 1.2 and 1.3:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>Auxiliary Data</i> API was added to allow a game to
create state files in the file system of the cartridge. &nbsp;The
motivation for this API is to allow the travelling data in Animal
Forest to be handled
cleanly within the game itself. &nbsp;For documentation on this new
API,
please refer to the following link:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/auxdata.html">file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/auxdata.html</a><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from SDK v1.3 to v1.4</h3>
The following features were added between versions 1.3 and 1.4:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>rommd</i> utility was updated with the "-u" option to
specify
the number of auxiliary files a game can have. This limit is enforced
when
saving an auxiliary data file.</li>
</ul>
The following bugs were fixed in version 1.4:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>Auxiliary Data</i> API routines were modified to allow
them to work properly in a game that does cartridge (PI) DMA.
&nbsp;This change includes the addition of an initialization routine
that must be called before using the <i>Auxiliary Data </i>API (<i>osBbAuxDataInit</i>).
&nbsp;Please
refer to the <i>Auxiliary Data</i> API documentation for details:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/auxdata.html">file:///opt/ique/sdk/doc/auxdata.html</a></li>
  </ul>
  <li><i>osBbAuxDataIds</i> has been enhanced to return an error code
(instead
of reporting 0) if the cartridge was removed or changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from SDK v1.4 to v1.5</h3>
The following changes were made between versions 1.4 and 1.5:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">osBbAuxDataInit</span>
call was changed to take the buffer used by the underlying file system
calls as a parameter.&nbsp; This allows the game developers to control
the location of the required 32KB buffer.&nbsp; Please
refer to the <i>Auxiliary Data</i> API documentation for details:</li>
